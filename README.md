# FIFA-2024-Player-Value-Prediction-and-Regression-Analysis


Objective: Develop a predictive model for player values and explore market valuation dynamics in professional soccer team management using the FIFA 24 Player Stats Dataset.

Dataset Exploration: Meticulous examination, emphasizing data cleaning, formatting, outlier treatment, and standard scaling for integrity and analysis readiness. Collinearity and correlation patterns are studied to understand player statistics relationships.

Feature Selection: Employ feature selection techniques to identify influential factors in predicting player values, crucial for constructing a streamlined model.

Regression Techniques: Utilize various regression techniques including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost to uncover different facets of player valuation dynamics.

Linear Regression: Focus on Linear Regression as the primary model, aiming to reveal linear relationships between player statistics and market values. Logarithmic and box-cox transformations are applied to normalize and stabilize the dependent variable (player value).

Hypothesis Testing: Engage in hypothesis testing to determine the significance of player roles on predicted values, providing deeper insights into role-dependent dynamics impacting a player's market value.

Advanced Models: Explore advanced models like Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost to mitigate overfitting, enhance model generalization, and capture intricate patterns within player statistics.

Empowerment: Aim to empower soccer clubs with actionable insights, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of individual player values and role-dependent dynamics in bidding and team-building processes within FIFA 24.
